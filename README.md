# O'RLY Cover Generator

O'RLY Cover Generator is a parody book cover generator, 
implemented in Golang and Vue.js,
supporting a wide range of language including CJK.

O'RLY is living at https://rly.nanmu.me/

# Develop O'RLY

O'RLY consists of an API instance and a static frontend:

* API source lies in `cmd/rly`;
* Frontend source lies in `frontend`

Animal images and font files are in `coverimage` and `font`
respectively.

More documentations can be found in their directory.

# Contributes O'RLY

Contributions are always welcome!

Here are a few directions if you are interested:

* Help translating the frontend(we are using Vue i18n)
* Improve O'RLY
* Add New Features
* Raise a bug report

Or simply...

* Sharing the fun :wink:

# Projects in Brotherhood

There are several projects which share the idea:

* [O RLY Cover Generator on dev.to](https://dev.to/rly), where this project gets idea, supporting English only(partial reason for me to build O'RLY), there is also a [slack integration](https://dev.to/rlyslack). 
* [Japanese O'Reilly Generator](http://oreilly-generator.com/), with really good user experience, covers are generated in your browser

# Paperwork

"O'RLY Cover Generator" is just a parody, and it has no concern with O'Reilly Media. 

This work uses Source Han Serif and Source Han Sans from Adobe and Google, 
 with participation from partner foundries Changzhou SinoType in China, 
 Iwata Corporation in Japan, and Sandoll Communications in Korea. 
 
This work uses TrueType version of Source Sans Pro from Adobe by Paul D. Hunt.

The animal(well, not all of them are animal) images are from the [USF ClipArt ETC](https://etc.usf.edu/clipart/) project.
